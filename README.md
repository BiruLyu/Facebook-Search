# Responsive Web Design

Created a webpage that allows users to query aboutusers, pages, groups, events and places. A PHP script is deployed on Google Cloud App Engine to return a JSON formatted datastream to the front-end. The client parses the JSON data and renders it in a nicer-looking, responsive UI(using Bootstrap).
